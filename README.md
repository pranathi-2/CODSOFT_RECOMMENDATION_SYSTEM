# CODSOFT_RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM
This Python script fetches books from the Google Books API based on a given query (default: "fiction") and recommends a random one.
It works as follows:
->Fetches Books: Uses the Google Books API to retrieve book information.
->Creates DataFrame: Organizes the fetched data into a pandas DataFrame.
->Recommends a Book: Selects a random book from the DataFrame and displays its details.
Let's check out how I implemented it using python script.
